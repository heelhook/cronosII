# README-developers	A place to leave messages out of the user stream ##  CVS only ?? ##
# I guess this could have been called BUGS but I wanted something a little more generic.
# The intention is to erase stuff as we finish with  it not keep it. (the .changelog forces emacs to give me a pretty format)

	* The BOUNCE BUG.
	* Description	
	Recieving a return error 550 (unknown domain for email address) message from my ISP causes Cronos to
	seg fault. However not immediately: 

	To crash you have to have selected the message and / or
		||- attempted to compose and then send a mail
		||- double click the message in the message list (attempt to view properties)
	* Observations  notes
	The message shows three attachments :
		1 the error message from the host server
		2 the IMAP header sumary (guess)
		3 (CLUE ?) a strange little attachment with unreadable (base 64 ?) characters as a name.
	My local MTA (Exim is kool) does not cause any problems at all. So far it has behaved flawlessly and seems
	a great enhancement to Cronos. In fact using my local server is work around for this bug.
	
	My version of Strace may be broken at the moment (??) but it hangs when running cronos locking up the terminal
	and locking out the window manager.. Xserver can be killed from keyboard and mouse still moves..
	GDB reports no other problems when running normally. I have not had the "good" fortune to have it running 
	when I've had this bug. I am going to attempt to contrive a situation where this happens.
	
	There are still some "out of range" errors being produced by GTK .. These are NOT fatal,
	just stuff to do with progress bars. 

	Removing the offending file and index entry from the .CronosII/*.mbx && index solves problem.
	
	* Suspicions (dweeb warning)
	It would appear to crash when trying to rewrite index and mailbox files, _perhaps_ rc files as well.
	This MAY be related to the char bug reported at Debian developers ( Bug #126228).  In fact before I applied their patch 
	Cronos II would crash on attempting to _open_ such a mail.

	* Actions from here:
	I will generate reports for anybody who wants to contribute but this really seems way too low
	level for me.(at the moment). 

	* Supporting Information:
	 Bug #126228
	Package: cronosii
	Version: 0.2.2-3.1 at Debian Developers. They are noe on release 4 and I have applied the patch to the CronosII CVS,
	So this is hopefully old news. And it checks out OK here. (see notes above)
