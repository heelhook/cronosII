Addendum: Dec 01 2001:

# This is probably the last version of CronosII in this format.#

The new version is very promising and nearing release at this time (Dec 01 2001).
 I am sure you will find that it has been worth the wait. 
In the interests of our current users and stability I will endeavour to maintain the Maintenance Versions until the new Scratch version goes stable.
#At that time support for this version of CronosII will be discontinued.#
Please Note: The real coders are working on the new version not this one. :)

	i.e. I do my best but "hacker" is NOT one of the words used to describe me.
