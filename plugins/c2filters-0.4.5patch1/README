ConosII Message Filters 0.4.5-patch1
CronosII Filters
A CronosII Plugin

By Bosko Blagojevic <falling@users.sourceforge.net>

This plugin is a work in progress and is in no way finished 
yet. It equips CronosII with basic message filtering capabilities.

It requires CronosII 0.2.2

NOTE: This will most likely be the last release of CronosII Filters for the
old 0.2.x series. The next release will probably be based on the new
complete re-write of CronosII that we are currently involved in. Enjoy and
keep checking our website for updates on the CronosII rewrite progress
(cronosII-scratch).



To build simply type: make

If you have trouble building (i.e. missing working cronosII 0.2.1 headers),
take the following steps:

1) Download CronosII 0.2.1 from http://www.cronosii.net/
2) Extract the CronosII 0.2.1 source
3) su to root
4) rm -rf /usr/local/include/cronosII; rm /usr/local/include/cronosII.h
5) cd cronosII-0.2.1/src
6) ./configure
7) mkdir /usr/local/include/cronosII
8) cp *.h /usr/local/include/cronosII/
9) cp ../*.h /usr/local/include/cronosII/
10) cp cronosII.h /usr/local/include/

NOTE: Only try this if you cannot build filters normally! Think about the
commands you are giving before you hit enter!

TODO:
* import/export config files
* document functions (CronosII style)
* fix bugs as you find them
* make code prettier and/or more efficient as you see fit
* make gui prettier and/or more usable as you see fit
* Implement more possible actions on messages:
     - Expunge?
     - Play a sound?
     - more?
