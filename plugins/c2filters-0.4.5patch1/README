CronosII Message Filters 0.4.5-patch1
CronosII Filters
A CronosII Plugin

By Bosko Blagojevic <falling@users.sourceforge.net>

This plugin is a work in progress and is in no way finished 
yet. It equips CronosII with basic message filtering capabilities.

It requires CronosII 0.2.2

NOTE: This will most likely be the last release of CronosII Filters for the
old 0.2.x series. The next release will probably be based on the new
complete re-write of CronosII that we are currently involved in. Enjoy and
keep checking our website for updates on the CronosII rewrite progress
(cronosII-scratch).

To build simple type: make.
**************************
To install : make install (with admin. permissions)

OR : cp *.so to top-level directory (cronosii/) and : make install from there.
*****************************************************************
TODO:
* import/export config files
* document functions (CronosII style)
* fix bugs as you find them
* make code prettier and/or more efficient as you see fit
* make gui prettier and/or more usable as you see fit
* Implement more possible actions on messages:
     - Expunge?
     - Play a sound?
     - more?

The headers are now included in the tarball as a common set of headers for all plugins.
