About:

	Basically, This plugin strips the html tags out of emails,
	if the email contains <html> in it. Very simple and such.

How to Install:
	
	$ make;
	$ cronos
	[Settings]
	->[Preferences...]
	[+] Plug-Ins
	->[ > Load... ]
	
	(find the nohtml.so file)
	
	CronosII will now install the nohtml.so plugin
	to ~/.CronosII/Plugins -- and it should now work
	fine.

Notes:

	You may have to install the header (.h) files from
	cronosII-0.2.1 in order to get this to compile,
	instructions to do that can be found in the latest
	cronosII distribution, in the /plugins directory
	(I think).
