	- modified nohtml.c includes to use the headers edited by Angel Ramos.
	- moved all headers for all plug-ins to a common directory. (../headers)
	- edited all current dot C files to use these. 
		* To save space and make it simple to add new plug-ins.
		* I will keep the originals as separate packages as well, with the same directory structure.
		* Perhaps one day a better coder than I can work out how to build them with the rest of the source. ( I have tried but I just don't get it !)
	- Note I have assumed that the warnings:
	
nohtml.c: In function `plugin_load_configuration':
nohtml.c:158: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
nohtml.c:160: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
nohtml.c:161: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
	are just for a gnome error message and as I cannot see how a char gets itself defined again as an integer well... best left alone. 
	- I have also assumed that Mr Racoon intended there be a "notify me if you get a message from this mail address" -- configuration dialog<breath> in place as a groovy feature. :)
