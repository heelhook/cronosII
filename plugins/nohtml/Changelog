	- YES! Got all the configure stuff working totally, so that the options actually
	  do something. I think I found a bug in cronos too... but anyways. I dont think
	  its worth the effort of fixing it as soon I'll (hopefully) be working on scratch,
	  and its not a very obvious bug either.
	- Got basic &symbol; type replacement working too. :-)
	- Changed Version info to 0.1.0 ... Its all working, and no visible traces of 
	  the sample plugin left, so I thought it was about time.
	- Updated the README file a bit. Still needs some more, perhaps.
	- Fixed lots and lots of bugs.
	- Created lots and lots of bugs.
	- Fixed them as well.

	- Added a bit better Parsing of HTML, now does <br> and such.
	- Made the configure window work properly with all options and such. (lol Pete!)
	- Wondered briefly about adding an easter egg. I've still got one and a half left.
	- Added a bit more commenting.

07 April  2002 Pete <petergozz@users.sf.net>
	- modified nohtml.c includes to use the headers edited by Angel Ramos.
	- moved all headers for all plug-ins to a common directory. (../headers)
	- edited all current dot C files to use these. 
		* To save space and make it simple to add new plug-ins.
		* I will keep the originals as separate packages as well, with the same directory structure.
		* Perhaps one day a better coder than I can work out how to build them with the rest of the 
		  source. ( I have tried but I just don't get it !)
	- Note I have assumed that the warnings:
	
nohtml.c: In function `plugin_load_configuration':
nohtml.c:158: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
nohtml.c:160: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
nohtml.c:161: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast

	are just for a gnome error message and as I cannot see how a char gets itself defined again 
	as an integer well... best left alone.
	- I have also assumed that Mr Racoon intended there be a "notify me if you get a message from this mail address" -- configuration dialog<breath> in place as a groovy feature. :)
