	* Updated nohtml to Daniels latest version.
	* Tested this plugin on various sources and with various configuration options and all went well. 
	* Rebuilt all plugin tarballs to include headers and cvs...

Mon 08 Apr 2002 Pete <petergozz@users.sf.net>
	* Merged Angel Ramos's new headers into source tree all headers moved to /headers. The only complication this should add is when distributing standalone packages of the plugins. These will need packaging with the headers directory included.
	* Failed to get the things to build with the source however they will build as separate binaries. Hopefully this will simplify building for non i386 platforms much easier.
	* Added Mad Profs new (alpha level) plugin. "NOHTML" 
	* Edited all source files to include the new common plugins headers.
	* Added readme to headers/ .
	
Thur 07 Feb 2002  Pete <petergozz@users.sf.net>
	* moved all source level makefiles to MakefileORIG.
	* updated Makefile.am (./) to include them in tar dist builds.
Mon 04 Feb 2002 Pete <petergozz@users.sf.net>
	* Removed CVS directories from fortune.
	* Attempted (again) to build a deb.
	* Left tarball unpacked and check make files (build RPM and DEBS)
	* Removed tarballs to save bandwidth. 
Wed 19 Dec Pete <petergozz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Applied patch1 to Filters 
	* Rebuilt binary to new state
	
Sat 15 Dec 2001 Pete <petergozz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Updated Filters to Bosco's final version.
	* Updated source docs to reflect this.
	

Wed 13 Dec 2001 Pete<petergozz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Brought the filters up to the latest version I could find. (0.4.0)
	* Note make dist will fail due to the inclusion of filters and fortune
	* in Makefile.am They can be removed from that file quite safely.
	* (I am a little nervous about the binaries being in place during a
	* build. It works fine here (both packed and unpacked) but I can't
	* check other dists and OS so there ya go.

Sat Dec  1 17:19:23 CST 2001  Peter Gossner <petergozz@users.sourceforge.net>
	*	Modified all source files to enable successful build.
	*	Removed status line support for sample.c
	*	added the define to the top of filters.c
	* 	modified header calls to fix typos.
	*	traced these through the MR2 source all is well.
