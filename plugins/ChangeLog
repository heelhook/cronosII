	* Brought the filters up to the latest version I could find. (0.4.0)
	* Note make dist will fail due to the inclusion of filters and fortune
	* in Makefile.am They can be removed from that file quite safely.

	* build. It works fine here (both packed and unpacked) but I can't
	* check other dists and OS so there ya go.
