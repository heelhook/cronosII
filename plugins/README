This  Directory contains a clunky work around to have plugins working on CronosII -MR2

There are at least two ways of installing the plugins.
1.  (the quick and nasty way)
######################################################################
To install the built binaries :
<example>
$tar -zxvf Fortune-Plugin.tar.gz

$cd fortune/
$su
$password
$make install.
$exit
$cronos &
configure the plugins from the the Main Window
settings > preferences > plugins

NOTE these binaries built on 2.2.20 LINUX i686 box.

They should work on most other systems i686 and up.
With CronosII-0.2.2 installed.

(thats a totally uneducated guess really )

ELSE
###########################################################
2.  A  more graceful way in that the binaries will be built to your system.

 (use the sources included here they are pre-patched and slightly modified )
######################################################################
a/ download the source tar ball for CronosII 0.2.1
	< http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7093 >
b/. Important:  back up your current ~/.cronos directory (or just move it)

c/ install the 0.2.1 package.
	(if you still have a .cronosII directory from vers2.2.0 or up the app will seg fault on launch -- don't worry you wont be using it )
d/ build the plugins from this directory (cp them to the 0.2.1 src/plugins directory if you like)

e/ make install (as root if you need to)

f/ install version 0.2.2 mr2  

all should be well.

this works .
(just don't ask me why :))


If anybody has a fix for this I would be eager to hear about it.

mail to: gossner@arcom.com.au

Hope this helps.
