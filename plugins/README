This  Directory contains a clunky work around to have plugins working on CronosII -MR2

There are at least two ways of installing the plugins.
1.  (the quick and nasty way)
######################################################################
To install the built binaries :
<example>
$tar -zxvf Fortune-Plugin.tar.gz

$cd fortune/
$su
$password
$make install.
$exit
$cronos &
configure the plugins from the the Main Window
settings > preferences > plugins

NOTE these binaries built on 2.2.20 LINUX i686 box.

They should work on most other systems i686 and up.
With CronosII-0.2.2 installed.

(thats a totally uneducated guess really )
A solution to a  non-asked question :

You may have a problem with the INSTALL step if you have more than one version of cronosII-config on your system. eg. You have installed to different prefixes and or you have been using the new scratch version. Do a ]make uninstall then make install for  a quick fix. Otherwise you will have to locate the offending versions and uninstall by hand. (which and type are handy here).


ELSE
###########################################################
2.  A  more graceful way in that the binaries will be built to your system.

 (use the sources included here they are pre-patched and slightly modified )
######################################################################
a/ download the source tar ball for CronosII 0.2.1
	< http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7093 >
b/. Important:  back up your current ~/.cronos directory (or just move it)

c/ install the 0.2.1 package.
	(if you still have a .cronosII directory from vers2.2.0 or up the app will seg fault on launch -- don't worry you wont be using it )
d/ build the plugins from this directory (cp them to the 0.2.1 src/plugins directory if you like)

e/ make install (as root if you need to)

f/ install version 0.2.2 mr2  

all should be well.

####################################################################

this works .
(just don't ask me why :))

Finally: The alterations made to the sample plugin cause a dialog to open each time CronosII checks your mail. Click it an it goes away. It's sort of handy during but can be annoying. Feel free to fix this.

If anybody has a fix for this or any other bugs; I would be eager to hear about it.

mail to: gossner@arcom.com.au

Hope this helps.

Post Script.
I will work toward a real and transparent fix for this..
