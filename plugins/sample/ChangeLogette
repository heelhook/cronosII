Thur 7 Feb 2002 Pete <petergozz@users.sf.net>
	* Moved Makefile to MakefileORIG to check I wasn't including it in
	* package builds. (yes I know I wasn't but ..)

Wed 12 Dec 2001 Peter Gossner <petergozz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added to object and static object files which I had obviously
	* forgotten to cvs add...DOH.

Sat 01 Dec 2001 Peter Gossner <petergozz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Removed support for mainwindow status messages as the plugin
	would not build with it. (its just commented out so give it a go
	YMMV)
	* Please see ../README for install instructions.
