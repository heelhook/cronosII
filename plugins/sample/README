The sample.so (binary) here was built originally under CronosII ver 0.2.1 and simply copied here.

If you wish to attempt a new build (good luck) backup the existing 'dot o' and 'dot so' files.
(You have been warned)
TO INSTALL: (default install path shown)
su
cp sample.so /usr/share/cronosII/plugins/
exit

cronos &
settings => preferences => plugins => load
