 Any sub-menu (flip out) menu item may have its shortcut altered from the default
 by simply leaving the mouse pointer over that item and entering the new shortcut.
 You don't have to press the control or alt (meta) keys as well, just any key not already being
 used in that particular menu.

  of the Application Window..
 </para>
 <para>Left Click over the raised (and textured) area at the left of the
 tool-bar you want to move. Now Drag it anywhere you like including
 onto your desktop. Often you can drag it to the side of the Application Window
  and have it set up running vertically down the 
 side of the Main Window. Some apps remember all of this as well.
