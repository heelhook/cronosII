Thank-You to all the people from about this  planet (at least)  who use Cronos II and by doing so give support to Open Source Software, GNU, GTK, GNOME, feedback to us, and a clear
sense of purpose (fear) to the development work.

<para>A special thanks to the hackers on the<emphasis> Debian (debian.bugs.dist) development newsgroup</emphasis> who fixed some bugs they found running under the Power PC platform. These same patches also fixed some stubborn bugs involving parsing mail headers and config files. </para><para>As near as I can tell these people where:
 Aaron Schrab , Jerry Quinn <email> jlquinn@us.ibm.com</email> "Seamus" <email>seamus@debian.org</email>. (They know where they are :) While I was trying to fix similar problems I may never have seen that solution. Which is why I do the docs :)</para>
<para>Finally I would like to thank Angel Ramos <email>seamus@debian.org</email> who is now the Debian Maintainer for the CronosII package. He saved me a lot of time at an important stage in this release. </para>
