    <subtitle> Cronos II 0.2.3   - Welcome to the real world. -</subtitle>
<para>To paraphrase Pablo's original announcement :</para>
<blockquote><attribution>Pablo </attribution>
<para>Cronos II 0.2.3 (aka "Welcome to the real world") is CronosII reborn.</para>

  <para>
 Cronos II is growing and is getting bigger,  when  I started
this project I didn't have any experience at all.  The  basics weren't
as strong as they are required to be for such a large  project (as this now
is), thus this version introduces nothing really new for the
end user, but introduces a LOT of changes for us, developers.</para> 
<para>
Basically, this version is more than just a *recode*, it's a restructuring
of Cronos II.
</para> 
<para>
The main source of Cronos II is separated from
the modules which interact with certain tasks.
Also, with this version, the manual I wrote (actually just
in CVS under the directory /documentation) titled "Cronos II Development manual"
is to start being used, so we all code with the same things.</para></blockquote>


<para>A browse of the new code however shows some major features under development ( some dramatic bug-fixes
and interapp compatibility) Every reported bug to date is being addressed and support for HTML and HTTP is in early development. So stand by for the next round .</para>
<para> The curious can check all of this out from CVS available from the &app; site. Please note however Version 0.2.3 aka Scratch will not work (yet) without major hacking. </para>
<para>The other major developments in place are the new stable address book and of course the<emphasis> implementation of filtering</emphasis>. (though this only works with version 0.2.1 - I believe).</para>
