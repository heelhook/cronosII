    <subtitle> Cronos II 0.2.3   - Welcome to the real world. -</subtitle>
<para>To paraphrase Pablo's original announcement :</para>
<blockquote><attribution>Pablo </attribution>
<para>Cronos II 0.2.3 (aka "Welcome to the real world") is Cronos II reborn.</para>

  <para>
 Cronos II is growing and is getting bigger,  when  I started
this project I didn't have any experience at all.  The  basics weren't
as strong as they are required to be for such a large  project (as this now
is), thus this version introduces nothing really new for the
end user, but introduces a LOT of changes for us, developers.</para> 
<para>
Basically, this version is more than just a *recode*, it's a restructuring
of Cronos II.
</para> 
<para>
The main source of Cronos II is separated from
the modules which interact with certain tasks.
Also, with this version, the manual I wrote (actually just
in CVS under the directory /documentation) titled "Cronos II Development manual"
is to start being used, so we all code with the same things.</para></blockquote>


<para>A browse of the new code however shows some major features under development ( some dramatic bug-fixes
and interapp compatibility) Every reported bug to date is being addressed and support for HTML and HTTP is in early development. So stand by for the next round .</para>
<para> The curious can check all of this out from CVS available from the &app; site. </para>
<para>The new Cronos II is getting very close to release, in fact it is already in daily use by some of the development team. Please note work on these Maintenance Releases will STOP when the New Cronos II goes stable beta. </para>
<para>The latest versions of both this stable version and the new "Scratch" Cronos II can be found at the Sourceforge CVS site. Please visit the<ulink type="http" url="&website"> Web site</ulink> first to catch any latest news.</para>
