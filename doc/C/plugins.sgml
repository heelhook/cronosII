<para>This is NOT a real doc. Currently it is just a place holder for CVS development,
please feel free to add to any of these documents!!</para>
<para>For now I will refer you to the <ulink url="&website;" type="http"> CronosII web site</ulink></para>
<para>However this is an area where Cronos promises much that is both fun and useful. Need a feature 
for your mail app then write one and plug it into Cronos, if it works and is useful why not release it so everybody may enjoy it.
