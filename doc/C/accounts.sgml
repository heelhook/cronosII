<title>Setting up your accounts</title>
<para>One of &app;'s major features is its  simple, flexible account support and configuration. Multiple POP and SMTP accounts are supported. These accounts may be almost anywhere ( your local computer included). &app; treats all mail accounts equally. You can for example route all your out going mail through your local MTA (Mail Transport Agent) and use other powerful mail filtering and queueing tools in combination with &app;</para>

    <title>Some More Spool Options</title>
<para>Here we enter a slightly more advanced area. Make sure you have everything else working before you try some of the following features.</para>
	
<sect3 id="MTA">
<title>Using a local Mail Transport Agent</title>
      <para><application> A Mail Transport Agent</application> (MTA) is the application that <emphasis> sends your mail</emphasis> to an email address on your network or the Internet. (It's just a big network after all) . &app; is a <application>Mail User Agent</application>, a client that fetches your mail from the mailbox the MTA delivered it to.</para>
      <para>Your system may have one of  
<application>Exim</application>  <application>Postfix</application> or <application>Sendmail</application>Installed.  I have tested all of these and they all work well. You will need to give the MTA the domain name of a "Smart Host". This can be the name you gave for the SMTP section of your POP account. (Often:  mail.yourisp.com.region ) </para>
<tip><para>There is extensive documentation available for these MTA's . Start with the man pages for the App installed on your system and do a search for the latest versions and info.</para></tip>
<para>The<application> procmail</application> - autonomous mail processor, is  often installed and can perform some of the functions of a MTA and do a lot of other useful stuff.  For lots of good security reason these applications are usually available only to the administrator or other trusted users. However normal users can access the services they provide. If you have the binary sendmail (look under /usr/sbin) then you probably have an MTA of some sort installed on your system.</para>
      <warning>

    <para>The installation and configuration of these is best left to the more experienced. <application>Exim</application>  installs and configures readily onto Debian systems (at least) and has the advantage of being fully Open Source. (GPL licence).</para>
<para>The actual command,  "sendmail" may not be available to you (for security reasons). Don't worry it will still work. See the following section.</para> </warning>
<note>
      <para>The above <emphasis>default</emphasis> description of <link linkend="configuration-spool-accounts">SPOOL account configuration</link> should work on most <application>LINUX or BSD</application>systems.</para>
<para> However if your local MTA is set up for moving mail off site, well then why not use it?</para>
<para>Here's how:</para></note>
<sect3 id="smtp-spool">
<title>Your Localhost</title>

	  <para>Make sure you enter a legitimate (and known)  email address into the email field.</para>

	<listitem><para>From this account, you should  be able to send mail to other users on your local network (or stand-alone machine) <emphasis>and send mail out, i.e. off-system </emphasis>via the Internet.(or whatever). The MTA will usually hold on to the message for you until you have a working network connection. (This includes but is not limited to TCP/IP (Internet))</para>
	  </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
<para>This approach offers you all the benefits of using a dedicated MUA (&app:) and all the functions that your MTA ( e.g. Sendmail ) offers. These include the ability to send mail while not connected, powerfull filtering, address aliasing, batching mail and even running mailing lists. Locally it means you can use the same interface to do all your mailing.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="mta-tips">
<title>Some Random Tips</title>      
<tip><para>Set up seperate mailboxes for each account and identity.</para>
<para>Use the Filters plugin for simple mail sorting and or to further refine any sorting done by procmail
or your MTA.</para>
	<para>Order your accounts so that the one you use most is first. (account 1)</para>
	<para>If you have a working MTA use it by default (account 1)</para>
	<para>Your &app; mailboxes and major configuration files are found under  $<command>cd  ~/.CronosII/</command></para>
	<para>Most configuration commands (including the Address Book) require you to set the change and then save it. Broadly this is like " try " and " ok " under Gnome.</para>
	<para>If you use a command line mailer  "mutt" "pine" "mail" etc. You can link the mboxes to &app; (via a local smtp / spool account). This is for reading only. &app; does not save mails in the "mail" style. </para>
	<para>You can also do this with the Netscape mailer, though the results are not elegant.</para>
	<para>Archive your mail regularly. Perhaps "cron" can do this for you.</para>
	<para>The lines of "?????????????" in mail files are &app;'s way of deleting stuff. Always copy or move to a &app; mailbox. Don't let &app; manage another mail apps files.. (generally speaking) </para>
