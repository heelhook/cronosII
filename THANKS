As this branch of CronosII draws near to a close.
It is appropriate to Thank all those people who used, broke and developed
CronosII and her Plugins.

Bug Reports and Feature wish lists are always welcome and CronosII-Scratch
grew out of such communication.

Different people have contributed in many different ways to this application, most
of them do not have many lines mostly they do NOT have many lines of code
next to their name. That does not make their contibution any less valuable,
perhaps the contrary is true. After all the Hackers need to know What to
Code. 

And The list is:
RMS and the Gnu team for bringing up the open source tools to work with.
Linus Torvalds for daring to GPL his baby Unix :)
The many hackers who have worked on the Kernels ever since.

For CronosII in Particular, I would like to Thank:
Yves Mettier, Marc Zaritsky, (finish me when you areawake)
